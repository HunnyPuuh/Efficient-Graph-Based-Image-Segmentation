# Efficient-Graph-Based-Image-Segmentation
This content is to replicate the algorithm proposed by Felzenszwalb, P.F. and Huttenlocher, D.P.(Efficient graph-based image segmentation) by **python**

You can also find details via http://cs.brown.edu/people/pfelzens/papers/seg-ijcv.pdf 

The authors also implement the alorithm in C++ and you can find it via http://cs.brown.edu/people/pfelzens/segment/

## Paper knowledge
In this part, I will illustrate authors' idea and notation :monocle_face:
